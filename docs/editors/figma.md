Follow these steps to start tracking your design work in Figma with Hackatime.

## Step 1: Log into Hackatime

Make sure you have a [Hackatime account](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and are logged in.

## Step 2: Install the Extension

Visit the [GitHub page](https://go.skyfall.dev/waka) and install the extension on Chrome or Firefox.

## Step 3: Configure API credentials

1. Click the "puzzle piece" icon on your toolbar
2. Click on "WakaTime for Figma"
3. For the API key, use your Hackatime API key (which is located [here](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup))
4. For the API URL, use `https://hackatime.hackclub.com/api/hackatime/v1`

## Troubleshooting

- **Plugin not working?** Try refreshing your Figma after installation. You should see a "WakaTime for Figma is running!" toast when you open a Figma design.
- **Using FigJam or Figma Slides?** The plugin currently doesn't support FigJam or Figma Slides - it only works for the main editor. If you would like support for this, open an issue on the extension's [GitHub page.](https://go.skyfall.dev/waka)
- **Is time being misattributed to different projects?** The extension uses your Figma filename as the Hackatime project name. So make sure it's not called "Untitled" or something similar!
- **Still stuck?** Ask for help in [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com) ([#figma-wakatime channel](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C092UUSQC01)), or open an issue to report bugs.

Once configured, your activity time will automatically appear on your [Hackatime dashboard](https://hackatime.hackclub.com). Happy designing!
